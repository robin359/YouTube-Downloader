# YouTube-Downloader

This little script helps you downloading single videos and whole playlists from YouTube. 
Currently it is a CLI tool, but I am working on making a GUI for it. 

## Usage
Download the script. Open up a terminal and execute the script with python3:

`python3 youtubeDownlaoder.py`

Then enter the URL, type mp3 for audio and mp4 for video file and enter a destination directory (optional)

Voil√° your file is downloaded!
